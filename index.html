          <p>Recently I found myself looking for a quick way to build a form field that returned HTML. The one I settled for was <a href='http://summernote.org/'><i>Summernote</i></a>.</p>
        
          <p>The biggest problem I had was finding a nice, minimal, example of using it. So I made one - <a href='./summernote.html'>Live demo</a> or <a href = 'https://github.com/davidbebb/davidbebb.github.io/blob/master/summernote.html'>source.</a></p>
        
          <p>Enjoy</p>

          <p><p>One of my continual concerns with coding is forgetting - when I've been away from a language for a while, it's slightly nerve racking to come back to it. </p><p>Enter codewars, a collection of coding challenges - or katas - mostly written by other developers using the site. I find this a great way of refreshing a language, and a good way of pushing my skills up a level, in a way that I probably won't with production code (because, best will in the world, I <i>care</i> about my production code working, so if I can I'll play safe and stick to what I know works, even if there are potentially faster or cleaner solutions). </p><p>Also, once I have completed a challenge, I get to see other solutions to the same problem, which is often educational, even if it's only to confirm ways you <i>wouldn't</i> want to see used to solve the problem. </p><p>I also like to use this to familiarise myself with a new language - after I've covered the basic tutorials, I find codewars an excellent way to cement what I've learnt - and to be a good way of getting myself used to the documentation conventions and sources for my new favourite language. </p><p>Finally, the because the way challenges are 'marked' is through a set of unit tests, I get quick exposure to these, something that is often missed in the tutorials. </p><p>So, whether you're leaning new, or sharpening up old, the number and variety, of the challenges on <a href='https://www.codewars.com/'>codewars</a> makes it a good place to know. </p></p>

          <p><p>For a number of years I built interactive exhibits for a small Science Museum. During this time, a pattern emerged: whatever we were building, I'd be looking for ways to improve and speed up the process. Whether it was a quicker way to prototype circuits, a better way to sand wood, or an optimisation in the way we machined plastics, I'd be thinking about it.<br></p><p>Fast forward to today, and I still hold true to this. Every project I work on I keep thinking how I can do this faster, or at least stop myself from spending this time again in future.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I have scripts for installing most of the tools that I've needed so far - certainly for those that needed more work than a simple apt-get. My gitconfig has been honed to a sharp collection of those commands that I just keep on using - and if it isn't in there, it's probably because I've not had to use that command that much (yet).</p><p>I even have a similar approach at home. Robots make my coffee and sweep my floors, all so I don't have to spend time on these repetitive tasks. &nbsp;</p><p>But there is always the question - is this really worth it? Does this actually save me any time or effort?</p><p>At this point, I turn to XKCD:</p><p><img src='https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png' style='width: 404px;'></p><p>So far, the first graph is closer to my truth than the second. How? It's simple. Keep It Simple and Stupid. Don't try to automate perfectly. Accept that, however good, your coffee machine will need you to add beans, and that you will need to empty the dust bin on your Roomba. Some bits are just not worth the effort of trying to automate.</p><p>The same holds true for software; If you try to build the huge, perfect, complete system on day one, you are almost always doomed to failure; there are too many things to do, and you either overlook or don't release the quick wins - the simple but time effective steps - so you don't get any quick benefit; and at the same time you're still having to do the task manually. You're refusing to use your coffee machine until the 20 tonne bean hopper, with integrated roaster is finished.</p><p>Maybe I should change: 'Never knowingly under or over mechanised'.</p></p>

            <h2>Nodemon - minimal config</h2>
            <p>A quick start Nodemon config</p>
        </header>

        <div class="info">
            <span class="date">

          <p><a href='https://nodemon.io/'>Nodemon</a> is a utility for node developers which monitors source code for changes and automatically restarts the server. This can save you a lot of key strokes, and from a fair amount of frustration over the course of a project.</p>
        
          <p>My preferred method for setting up nodemon is to use a config file. This is easy to share, easy to customise, and usually 'just works'.</p>
        
          <p>By default, nodemon looks for a config file called 'nodemon.json'.</p>
        
          <p>Below is my default minimal config. It covers the functionality that I normally want when I start a project, whilst preserving the nodemon defaults. It's easy to specify what to watch (by path and extension) and importantly, tells you <i>which file changed and caused it to restart</i>.</p>

            <h2>Searching bash history</h2>

        </div>
        
        
          <p>One of the things I love about using bash is how that you can access previous commands - it remembers them so I don't have to.</p>
        
          <p>Unfortunately, this isn't always easy if it's been a while since you used that command - this is my method for solving this issue.</p>
        
          <p><p>First up is working out how bash does this feat of memory - simple. On most setups using bash, in your home directory there is a file called .bash_history (note the dot). This contains an almost complete list of run commands - the exceptions I've found are </p>
        
          <p>a) if you force a bash window to close unexpectedly the history is not always written, and </p>
        
          <p>b) if you start the command with a space (a deliberate feature to allow you to select those things you don't want preserved for prosperity).</p></p>
        
          <p><p>To find a previous command, we're going to use grep, a commandline utility for searching plain text files.</p></p>
        
          <p><p>The basic grep command looks something like</p><p><b>$ grep &lt;search-string&gt; &lt;file to be searched&gt;</b></p></p>
        
          <p><p>So, as long as you can remember part of the command, you can probably find it again.</p></p>
        
          <p><p>For example, I know I used some of the inkscape command line arguments to convert some engineering diagrams to svg - I'd like to do that again, but it was about a month ago, and I have no idea what the command was.</p></p>
        
          <p><script src='https://gist.github.com/davidbebb/338e5a7d602dc5aa67c5365333bde365.js'></script></p>
        
          <p><p>Bingo. <b>$ inkscape &nbsp;--without-gui --file=inFile.pdf --export-plain-svg=outFile.svg </b> it is.</p></p></p>
