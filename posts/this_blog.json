    "In the past, I've found myself digging through backups and configs to remember 'how I solved that last time'. This is my solution to that problem. Most of the content here is written as a reminder to myself: lots of links and limited context (enough so that I can ask google to look through my own site to find what I want). There are occasional exceptions, but usually they're added as a way of clarifying my own throughts on a question, rather than in any expectation of them actually being read.",
