    "<a href='https://nodemon.io/'>Nodemon</a> is a utility for node developers which monitors source code for changes and automatically restarts the server. This can save you a lot of key strokes, and from a fair amount of frustration over the course of a project.",
    "My preferred method for setting up nodemon is to use a config file. This is easy to share, easy to customise, and usually 'just works'.",
    "By default, nodemon looks for a config file called 'nodemon.json'.",
    "Below is my default minimal config. It covers the functionality that I normally want when I start a project, whilst preserving the nodemon defaults. It's easy to specify what to watch (by path and extension) and importantly, tells you <i>which file changed and caused it to restart</i>.",
