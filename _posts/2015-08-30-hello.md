##The story so far

Hi, I'm David. If you wanted to know.

I've spent the last 4 years of my life playing, hacking & building cool stuff for an  <a href="http://www.cambridgesciencecentre.org">Educational Charity</a>.
This has been an amazing time, with some incredible people meeting some ridiculous challenges to create something which, in my mind at least, is pretty special.

But it's time for a new challenge.

So, after some googling, much deliberation, and a few pints I applied to join  <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a>.

And they accepted me.

The challenge was set.

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, caffeine to code
